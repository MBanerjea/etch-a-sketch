First Trial ----- 12-02-2023

Project Completed ----- 19-02-2023

I have tried to stick to the exact instructions provided in the project outline:

1. Create grids
2. Add hover effect
3. Add a button

For extra credit portion:

1. Change box to random RGB value
2. Each pass adds 10% black to the random colour so that the box turns black in 10 passes.

The gradual change of RANDOM colours to black and not just grey or white to black was deliberate as I felt that is what the project outline instructed us to do.

The most difficult bit was to figure out how to store an invisible value in a div that can be changed at a later point.

The project still isn't perfect. However it gets the job done for now.

Hope this helps someone.
